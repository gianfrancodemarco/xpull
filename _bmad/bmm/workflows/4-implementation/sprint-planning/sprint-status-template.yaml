# Deprecated: sprint-status YAML template
# Epics are now managed on GitHub as issues (label `epic`) and stories as issues (label `story`).
#
# Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to create, list, and update epics and stories. Example commands:
#
# - List epic issues: gh issue list --label epic --repo {github_owner}/{github_repo}
# - Create an epic issue: gh issue create --title "Epic: <title>" --label epic --repo {github_owner}/{github_repo}
# - Link stories to an epic by using issue references and labels
#
# This file is intentionally deprecated and retained only for historical reference.
